**Title**: Pointers Basics in C++

## Objective
To understand the concept of pointers in C++ by:
- Declaring and initializing a pointer.
- Displaying the value and address of a variable.
- Displaying the value stored in a pointer.
- Using the dereference operator to access the value stored at the pointer location.

---

## Key Concepts Covered
- Pointers
- Address-of operator `&`
- Dereference operator `*`
- Pointer and data type sizes (if uncommented)

---

## Algorithm: Understanding Pointers in C++  

Step1: Start  
Step 2: Declare an integer variable a and initialize it with a value (e.g., a = 10).  
Step 3: Declare a pointer variable aptr and assign it the address of a using the address-of operator &.  
Step 4: Display the following using cout:  
- Value of a
- Address of a (i.e., &a)
- Value of aptr (which should be same as &a)
- Value pointed to by aptr using the dereference operator *.
Step 5: Display:
- Address of the pointer variable aptr
- Size of a, aptr, and data types using sizeof().
Step 6: End

## Conclusion
This experiment helps reinforce understanding of pointer fundamentals in C++. It lays the groundwork for dynamic memory allocation and pointer arithmetic in future programs.
